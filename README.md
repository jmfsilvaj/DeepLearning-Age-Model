# Age Estimation Model Project

This repository contains all the necessary components for the Age Estimation Model, a Deep learning project aimed at predicting a person's age based on certain features.

## Structure

- `Data/`: This directory contains the dataset link and any relevant data files.
- `Notebook/`: Here you'll find the Jupyter notebooks, including `Age_model.ipynb` which contains the code for our age prediction model.
- `Plots/`: Visualizations and plots generated from the analysis and model predictions are stored here.
- `Report/`: Contains the comprehensive report of our project in PDF format.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you should:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Download the dataset using the link provided in `Data/link_dataset_GROUP13.txt`.
4. Explore the Jupyter notebook in the `Notebook/` directory to understand the model.

## Usage

To use the Age Estimation Model:

1. Navigate to the `Notebook/` directory.
2. Open `Age_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in order to reproduce.
